# UCI_Energy_Prediction_Model
## Objective:
The objective of the study is to understand the time series dataset for UCI energy use of Appliances along with
various factors of impact like Temperature and Relative Humidity of internal environment, Pressure, Windspeed,
Visibility of external environment and develop models for prediction for energy use. The problem comes under
regression analysis and hence regression models will be constructed.
